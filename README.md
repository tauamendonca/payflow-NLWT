# Payflow

Project created following the Flutter classes from Rocketseat's Next Level Week Together event. 

## The project

This project is meant to save your bills by reading their barcode through the camera using Firebase machine learning. It uses social login through Firebase and contain some animations. Also, there are some functionalities that are meant to be added as a challenge in the end of the event. 

Right now: Starting development of this project, following the second day of class.

The event was comprised of 5 days of classes, where:

1st class: A brief introduction about Flutter, what it can do and how to create your first flutter app, along with some concepts like stateful and stateless. 

2nd class: Splash and Login screens, layout only, with social login button. Styles and theme. Basic structure for the home page.

3rd class: Firebase connection, social login.
(implementing this class right now)

4th class: TBA

5th class: TBA


## Challenges

Up to now the challenges that were talked about in the classes and that I will (try to) implement are:

- Filter the bills by month or other data
- Use the barcode to fill the bills data

My added challenge, for after the event, will be the creation of a copy of this project and changing it into a product registry that can also mantain records about stock levels of goods and/or frequency of substitution of them.
