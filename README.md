# Payflow

Project created following the Flutter classes from Rocketseat's Next Level Week Together event. 

## The project

This project is meant to save your bills by reading their barcode through the camera using Firebase machine learning. It uses social login through Firebase and contain some animations. Also, there are some functionalities that are meant to be added as a challenge in the end of the event. 

Right now: Starting development of this project, following the second day of class.

The event was comprised of 5 days of classes, where some of the content is:

1st class: A brief introduction about Flutter, what it can do and how to create your first flutter app, along with some concepts like stateful and stateless. 

2nd class: Splash and Login screens, layout only, with social login button. Styles and theme. Basic structure for the home page.

3rd class: Firebase connection, social login.

4th class: Navigation, Barcode Scanner backend and page, camera widget, listeners.

5th class: Bills screen, animation, controlling, adding and saving bills.
